Day1-> i used my etch the sketch technique and i tweeked
 it little and make turtle movement automatic
 and by using WASD key to move it up down left right 

19:23 17-11-2023
Day2-> at this point my turtule can move aimlessly to the ends of infinity
 i gave it a square defination and limited its move between 600 by 600 screen 
using while loop which breaks if x_cor or y_cor exceeds it now i worked on 
segment part which on increse in score will increas as well and will get added to 
the segment list

Day3-> today i worked on food module where i gave defination on how food will 
work for snake and will also increase score at this point i felt i need a separate 
module for score board where score and game over will be displayed so i used 
documention, found that we can use write() function to write on screen so 
worked on it at this point i have 3 module main, food, scoreboard

Day4-> today i worked on tail collison working on it i stuck on some logic error, 
didnt know how to connet all the end where i have to end the game when collision happens 
and game over has to be displayed all togather then i thought to make a sepreate module for snake
so i did that where i defined everything from movement to segment but  still i am facing error

Day5-> asked from friend about the error.....got some hint over logic and used class and inheritance  to 
get my logics done and finally connecting every thing under same while loop and completed it today u can see time stamp 
its mid night i am feeling so good seeing my game run smoothly, it was worth the hard work
